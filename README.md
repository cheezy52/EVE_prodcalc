EVE_prodcalc
============

Production and profit calculations for the game EVE Online.  This tool is intended to give industrialists and inventors a handy way to check which items will be most profitable to produce from amongst the myriad choices available.

Tools used:
Python 2.7.6
PostgreSQL as database (with PsycoPG2 as interface with Python)
Flask as web layer
EVELink (Python bindings for the EVE and EVE-Central APIs)
CCP Bulk Data dump, helpfully converted to PostgreSQL format by the fine folks at fuzzwork.co.uk

Under construction.  More to come soon.
